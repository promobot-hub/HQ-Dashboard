# TODO — Growth Micro-Tasks (Next Up)

- Add STATUS badge + live counters block to README and dashboard header (fast win, visibility up)
- Heartbeat widget in HQ-Dashboard: display last run, KPIs, and runsToday (read from API/file)
- GitHub skill check: add `gh auth status` probe + surface CI/last deploy on dashboard

Notes:
- Keep each as a single micro-commit. Ship one-by-one.
- Prioritize visibility improvements first (status badge + counters).
