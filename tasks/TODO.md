# TODO — Pipeline (2026-02-21 11:38 UTC)

- [x] Initialize heartbeat-state.json and STATUS.md to enforce cadence and KPIs.
- [x] Add counters (runsToday, totalRuns) persisted in heartbeat-state.json and surface them in README/STATUS.
- [ ] Wire a minimal script to auto-bump counters and append to log each heartbeat.
- [ ] Review GitHub push protection issue noted in MEMORY.md and decide on remediation path (rotate/remove secrets or override).
