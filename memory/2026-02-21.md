Quick win (cron): Established heartbeat tracking discipline.
- Added/confirmed heartbeat-state.json presence and set lastRun timestamp.
- Next micro-commit idea: add tasks/next-actions.md with 3 growth micro-tasks and wire into HEARTBEAT.md step 1.

Notes:
- Keep every cron doing 1 small, commit-ready change.
- Prioritize HQ-Dashboard repo check in next run.

Update 07:48 UTC:
- Created .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/growth.md to standardize micro growth tasks
- Marked TASKS.md item as done and updated CHANGELOG.md
