# 2026-02-21

- 08:07 UTC: Cron micro-task executed. Extended heartbeat-state.json schema to include placeholders for common checks (email, calendar, weather, mentions, github, dashboard). Next: wire heartbeat to update these fields during runs to minimize context load.
- 08:09 UTC: Updated README.md "Letzter Lauf" timestamp to 08:09 UTC to reflect current cron run; heartbeat-state.json already current.
