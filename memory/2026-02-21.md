# 2026-02-21

- Cron micro-task executed at 08:21 UTC.
- Created heartbeat-state.json to start tracking periodic checks and KPIs.
- Added CHANGELOG.md; updated STATUS.md and heartbeat-state KPIs; committed locally (no push without approval).
- KPIs: micro-commit ✅, state-updated ✅, skill-progress ❌ (not started in this quick pass).
- Next quick wins (suggested):
  - Add a minimal script to auto-bump lastRun in heartbeat-state.json on each cron.
  - Verify HQ-Dashboard repo linkage and plan a trivial UI polish commit.

Update 08:23 UTC:
- Implemented scripts/bumpHeartbeatState.js and ran it (state timestamps bumped). STATUS.md and CHANGELOG.md updated accordingly.
