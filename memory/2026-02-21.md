# 2026-02-21

08:01 UTC — Cron task executed (DENKE). Completed one quick internal step:
- Ensured heartbeat-state.json exists and is current.
- Added daily memory entry and updated long-term memory with "micro-commit per cron" rule.

Next micro-steps to consider today:
- Add a lightweight "progress score" tracker to heartbeat-state.json (0-10) and update per run.
- Verify GitHub auth via gh and list HQ-Dashboard open issues.
- Prep a default issue template for "Growth Micro-Task" in the repo.

08:02 UTC — Added growth/micro-wins/2026-02-21.md to track visible daily progress.
