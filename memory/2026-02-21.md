# 2026-02-21

07:53 UTC — Cron quick pass
- Action: Logged quick heartbeat note and ensured daily memory file exists.
- Rationale: Keep continuity and lightweight progress without external side effects.
- Next (tiny) candidates: add minimal heartbeat-state enrichment; create backlog stub for growth tasks.

07:54 UTC — Micro-improvement
- Created backlog/growth-tasks.md with 3 tiny, commit-ready tasks
- Updated heartbeat-state.json with lastBacklog timestamp and note

07:56 UTC — README Status added
- Added a Status section to README with last run timestamp and quick links (Docs, Netlify)
- Keeps repo frontpage informative and aligns with "tiny, commit-ready" improvements
