## Decisions / Plan
- Switch to GitHub-snapshot pipeline as primary data source (sandbox-safe): heartbeat/logs/tasks/metrics/skills/sessions under data/ → UI reads RAW.
- Build in-app, GH-backed Scheduler (jobs/history/execute) with UI at /scheduler; OpenClaw cron (5m) executes it and /api/cron/trigger.
- Improve via Git trigger (/api/improve/github) until Core HTTP is available; Core cron reads improve_trigger-*.json and acts.

## Tasks (tracking)
- [ ] Force redeploy so /api/scheduler/* and /scheduler are live; verify with JSON responses
- [ ] Add Sessions & Agents tile on Overview (from /api/sessions) with freshness badge
- [ ] Enhance ActivityFeed (auto-scroll, filters, smooth new badges)
- [ ] Health: show GitHub-Mode badge + data freshness ampels
- [ ] Append initial logs.ndjson entries for visibility
- [ ] Create/verify Evolution Cycle job (every 10m, action=trigger); Run due now once; confirm history write
- [ ] Optional: create Improve job (every 15m, action=improve)

## Evidence
- OpenClaw 5m cron ran repeatedly (20:55, 21:00, 21:05, 21:10, 21:15, 21:20 UTC). Each: snapshotOk=true, improveOk=false (HTTP core absent).
- Seeds committed to data/* visible via RAW; site APIs catching up post cache.

- 22:02 UTC: Micro-commit (DENKE): state/counters/STATUS/README synced; KPIs ok.
