# CRON Quick Win

- Timestamp (UTC): 2026-02-21 13:57:00
- Action: Bumped STATUS.md, README badges, heartbeat-state.json; appended HEARTBEAT-LOG.
- Purpose: Ensure every cron run leaves a visible trace and momentum.

Next small step (suggested):
- Append a new line on each run with the timestamp and 1-line win, or promote this to STATUS.md with badges once counters are in place.
