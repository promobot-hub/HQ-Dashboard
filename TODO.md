# TODO - Micro-Commit Backlog (High-Impact, Low-Effort)

1) HQ-Dashboard: Add GitHub workflow status widget (gh actions for main) – read-only, no secrets. 
2) HQ-Dashboard: Add simple "last deploy" timestamp badge (from Netlify build meta).
3) Skills: Read and summarize GitHub SKILL.md into INTERNAL-NOTES.md for faster ops.
4) Automation: Create scripts/heartbeat-update.ts to bump heartbeat-state automatically.
5) Docs: Add CONTRIBUTING.md with "micro-commit" philosophy and checklist.

Rule: Always pick the top item you can finish in <15 minutes. Commit separately.
