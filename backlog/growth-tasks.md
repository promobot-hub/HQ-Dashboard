# Growth Backlog (Tiny, Commit-Ready)

- Add a status section to README with: last heartbeat timestamp + quick links (docs, Netlify). Simple text first.
- Create a minimal `scripts/quick-health.sh` stub that echoes OK and timestamps; wire it into docs.
- Add `memory/README.md` explaining daily/long-term flow so future runs stay consistent.

Notes:
- Keep each task <10 minutes; prefer text/docs over code when uncertain.
- No external posting without explicit approval.
