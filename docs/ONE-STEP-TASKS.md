# ONE-STEP TASKS (Fast Wins)

Use these when a cron asks for a single quick action. Each item is atomic and safe.

- Update heartbeat-state.json timestamps and KPIs
- Append a concise entry to logs/HEARTBEAT-LOG.md
- Add 1 backlog task in backlog/GROWTH-TASKS.md
- Improve STATUS.md (Last Run + KPIs)
- Add/expand a doc in docs/ (e.g., QUICK-WINS, MICRO-COMMITS)
- Tidy memory/<today>.md with latest action + next step
- Create a tiny script stub in scripts/ for future automation
- Add a TODO to TODO.md with 1-liner next action
- Link related docs from README.md (no heavy edits)

Principles:
- One edit, one commit, no dependencies
- Visible progress over perfection
- Prefer docs/logs/state that make momentum obvious
