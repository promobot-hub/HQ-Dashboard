# ONE-STEP PLAYBOOK

Use these when you need a fast, single-turn win (<=60s):

- Update STATUS.md Last Run + KPIs
- Append a concise line to logs/HEARTBEAT-LOG.md
- Bump heartbeat-state.json timestamps (lastRun) and KPIs
- Add 1-page doc under docs/ (checklists, quick wins, playbooks)
- Append one line to memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md with action + next step
- Create/refresh a simple backlog item in backlog/
- Tighten README/HEARTBEAT.md phrasing (no breaking changes)

Rules:
- One step, no dependencies, immediately committable
- Prefer internal docs/state/logs over external actions
- Leave a clear "Next:" pointer for the following run
