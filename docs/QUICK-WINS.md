# QUICK WINS — One-Step Micro-Commits

Purpose: Keep momentum high with safe, internal-only improvements you can do in <2 minutes.

- Update heartbeat-state.json (cron_denke) timestamp
- Append a line to logs/CRON-DENKE-YYYY-MM-DD.md with time + action
- Bump STATUS.md "Last Run" and ensure README badges/timestamps are fresh
- Add a tiny doc under docs/ (e.g., ALERTS.md, QUICK-WINS.md, CHECKLIST.md)
- Create/append tasks/TODO.md with 1 concrete next micro-step

Rule: One action, zero external sends, immediate visibility.
