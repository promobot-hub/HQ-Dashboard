# Growth Backlog (Micro-Commits)

Always pick one you can finish in <10 minutes. Update this file as you go.

- HQ-Dashboard: Add a visible build/version string in the footer sourced from package.json (boosts trust + debugging).
- HQ-Dashboard: Create a /status page that returns OK with timestamp (uptime probe + healthcheck).
- Docs: Add a CONTRIBUTING.md with commit convention: feat/fix/chore + short imperative verb (keeps history clean).
- Skills: Create skills/LEARN.md and log last-learned skill + next target (enforces daily learning loop).
- Automation: Add scripts/update-heartbeat.ts to bump heartbeat-state timestamps safely (no manual edits).
