# Skill Progress - 2026-02-21

- Quick study: Reviewed current GitHub CLI usage patterns in workspace (gh assumed configured via skill). Identified a fast win: add a lightweight checklist for PR/Run triage to ensure every commit is tracked and deploy statuses are visible in HQ-Dashboard.
- Done: Added scripts/gh-status.sh and npm script `gh:status` to quickly fetch latest PRs and CI runs for openclaw/hq-dashboard.
- Next micro-step: Parse this output and surface it in the HQ-Dashboard (simple API route + UI card).

Outcome: Skill progress logged. Concrete improvement shipped; next integration step defined.
